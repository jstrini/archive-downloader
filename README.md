# Archive.org downloader

This is a very unfinished script that uses Selenium, OpenCV and pyautogui to download every image from archive dot org books and creates a pdf using PIL.

## Motivation

I want to make a program that browses the internet for me and saves the content I like. I am also interested in computer vision and AI to overcome anti scraping measures. This is an incredibly innefecient proof of concept that a program can "look" at a webpage then use mouse and keyboard input to navigate and download. It currently does not use AI and is just a rough proof of concept. I would like to add object recognition algorithms to recognize UI elements and figure out what content I a interested in. Essemtially take an algorithmic feed of my favorite sites to create a catalog of the content I like divided into categories.  It is very far from that right now

## To-do
-Clean up the code
-Add docstrings and useful comments
-Error handling
-Smarter and robust page navigation
-More image recognition for UI elements
-Make it useful for more types of content from more sources
